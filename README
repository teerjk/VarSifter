#  Compiling from source

1. Uncompress tar gzip file in working directory.

2. Create a folder in working directory called 'jung'

3. Download jung jar files from http://jung.sourceforge.net/
   VarSifter has been tested with jung2-2_0_1.zip.
   Unzip jung zipfile into 'jung' directory.
   NOTE: Make sure the jung/ directory contains the .jar files, not another directory!

4. If you have 'make' installed, simply run make.

If you do not have make installed, refer to the makefile for commands to use to build VarSifter.
The Makefile contains commands used to compile VarSifter, build a jarfile, and create Javadoc
documentation.
